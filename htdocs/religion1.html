<p>Many of the prints in
the collection reflect the belief in deities as causative agents of disease:
both smallpox and measles "gods" are shown again and again as forces to be
appeased, if not forcibly repelled. A
second, related category of prints reflects the inverse of this idea, by
showing Shinto or Buddhist deities who lead or sanction the fight against
disease.</p>

<p><a href="http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/hb7489p2rn/?order=1&brand=woodblock"><img src="images/p127.png" class="top-left-image" width="290" height="211" /></a>An 1858 print by Yoshikazu, titled "Various protective gods help good drugs
cure vicious diseases," depicts a battle between a group of armed soldiers and
their weak-looking opponents, semi-naked men in simple white robes piled
helter-skelter on the shoreline as they are attacked with bows, arrows, and staves. The soldiers' heads are spheres,
labeled with the names of various medicines (<i>semen</i>, or santonin, is one, <i>hiyosu</i>,
or henbane is another), while the enemy, given grimacing human heads, are
labeled food poisoning, stomach-ache, dropsy, and so on.</p>

<p>Seemingly directing the
battle from above is a figure labeled <i>gy&#363;t&#333;
tenn&#333;</i>, or Emperor Cowpox [Vaccine].
He directs the soldiers with a tree branch, as he leads a procession of
seven Shinto deities from the heavens.
In other words, it is through their intercession that the medicines are
effective.</p>

collection similarly include Shinto deities overseeing the suppression of
disease.</p>

Buddhist deity, Acala – in Japanese, Fud&#333; my&#333;&#333; – warding off
cholera.  Fud&#333; my&#333;&#333;
is also mentioned in some of the drug advertisements, as the creator of the
drug being advertised.  Buddhist imagery
appears in several of the prints in the collection.</p>
